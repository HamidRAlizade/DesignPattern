package com.hamidreza.alizade.designpattern.Command

/**
 * When you order some excellent Saag Paneer at an Indian restaurant,
 * you donâ€™t necessarily know which cook will prepare your dish;
 * you only give your order to the waiter,
 * who posts the order in the kitchen for the next available cook.

Similarly, the Command pattern lets you
issue requests without knowing the receiver. You encapsulate
a request as an object and send it off;
deciding how to complete the request is an entirely separate mechanism.
